Analytics cases: Yammer
Yammer is a social network for communicating with coworkers. Individuals share documents, updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. Yammer is free to use indefinitely, but companies must pay license fees if they want access to administrative controls, including integration with user management systems like ActiveDirectory.

Yammer has a centralized Analytics team, which sits in the Engineering organization. Their primary goal is to drive better product and business decisions using data. They do this partially by providing tools and education that make other teams within Yammer more effective at using data to make better decisions. They also perform ad-hoc analysis to support specific decisions.
